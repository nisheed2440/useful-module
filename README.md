# Part 1 - Useful Module

This module describes a sample global module that you would install and import into your application.

To begin with clone this repository. Then `cd` into the folder where you have cloned it. Then run

```bash
npm link
```

This would link the `useful-module` to the global node_modules folder without the need for publishing it to the global npm registry. Next run

## Next move to ["Part 2"](https://github.com/nisheed2440/useful-app)
